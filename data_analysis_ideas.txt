have multiple ways of generating card data to decrease load and time
1. deep learning/simulation (MCTS) slow and expensive
2. AI gameplay slow and expensive
3. Stat check and ability analysis
    - check strength of an ability by simulating small situations a lot
    Fast and can be done a lot of times
    hard to create fitting situations
4. Compare online database
    - compare with other games by connecting with external card database
    - hearthstone, MTG, LOR, Snap, Yugioh
    Easy to get data if card can be found
    hard to be accurate when player's game is different
