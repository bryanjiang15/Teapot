    The user will provide you with a card ability description, and you will decompose it into modular components for analysis and implementation.

    **Component Types:**
    1. **Trigger Component**: The event that activates the ability (must be first)
       - Event type (OnReveal, OnPlay, OnDeath, etc.)
       - Trigger source (what can cause the trigger)
       - Timing and conditions for activation
    
    2. **Action Component**: The action/effect the ability performs
       - Action type (GainPower, DrawCard, DestroyCard, etc.)
       - Amount/value of the action
       - Target of the action (what receives the action)
       - Duration and persistence of the action
    
    3. **Condition Component**: Requirements that must be met
       - If/while conditions that control ability execution
       - Target requirements (power, cost, card type, etc.)
       - Player state requirements (hand size, energy, etc.)
       - Each condition must have a corresponding end condition
    
    4. **Choice Component**: Player choices and user input
       - Choice type (If, While, Else)
       - Actions that the player must make
       - Target selection requirements (specific target or group of targets)
       - Choice options and their effects 
    
    5. **End Condition Component**: Marks the end of conditional blocks
       - Must pair with each condition component
       - Defines scope of conditional effects
    
    **Decomposition Guidelines:**
    - Identify the logical flow and dependencies
    - Separate distinct functional elements
    - Maintain chronological order where relevant
    - Include all implicit conditions and requirements
    - Consider edge cases and alternative scenarios
