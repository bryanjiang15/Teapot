# Game Description
‘‘‘
Marvel Snap is a fast-paced, strategic card game where players build a deck of 12 cards featuring Marvel characters and locations. The objective is to outwit your opponent by strategically playing your cards to increase your power level at three different locations. The player with the highest power level at most locations wins. If both player has won the same number of locations, the player with the highest total power level across all locations wins.

Game Setup

1. **Deck Building**: Each player starts by building a deck of 12 cards from their collection of Marvel characters. Player can include 1 copy of a card per deck.    

2. **Deck Selection**: Players select their deck and the game randomly assigns one of the three locations to each player. The locations are kept secret from the opponent until the game begins.

3. **Game Start**: The game begins with each player drawing three cards from their deck. The player who goes first is randomly determined.

Gameplay

1. **Turn Structure**: Each turn consists of the following phases:
   - **Draw Phase**: The player draws a card from their deck.
   - **Play Phase**: The player can play cards from their hand onto the three locations or use event cards from their hand.
   - **Discard Phase**: The player discards down to seven cards if they have more than seven cards in their hand.

2. **Card Types**:
   - **Characters**: These are the core cards in the game. Each character has a power level, a cost to play, and sometimes special abilities. Characters are played onto locations to increase the power level at that location.   
   - **Locations**: These are the three areas where characters are played. Each location has its own unique ability that can affect the game in various ways.

3. **Power Level**: The power level at each location is the sum of the power levels of all characters played there. The player with the highest power level at most locations wins.


## Win Condition

The game ends when one of the following conditions is met:

- Six rounds have been played.
- A player retreat from the game.

## Additional Rules

- **Hand Limit**: Players cannot have more than seven cards in their hand at the end of their turn. If a player draws a card and has more than seven cards, they must discard down to seven.
- **Location Swap**: Some cards have the ability to swap the locations of two characters. This can be used strategically to move characters to more favorable locations.
- **Steal**: Some cards have the ability to 'steal' a character from your opponent's location and move it to one of your own locations.
- **Destroy**: Some cards have the ability to destroy a character at a location, reducing the power level at that location.

These are the basic rules and mechanics of Marvel Snap. The game's strategic depth comes from the interactions between different cards, the unique abilities of each location, and the element of unpredictability introduced by the 'Snap' ability and event cards.
